        Use binary search with greedy check. Each check can be done in O(n) using a deque.
        Within a check, we iterate through the workers from the weakiest to the strongest.
        Each worker needs to take a task.

        There are two cases:

            The worker can take the easiest task available: we assign it to the worker.
            The worker cannot even take the easiest task: we give a pill to him and 
                let him take the hardest doable task.

        The deque will hold from the easiest unassigned task to the toughest that can be done
        by the current worker with a pill. If the easiest task can be handled by the
        weakiest worker, we assign it to the worker and do a popleft, 
        otherwise, we use one pill and pop from the right.
